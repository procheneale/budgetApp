# budgetApp
The budget app is a personal app to keep track of expenses. The app budgets an income with a 50/30/20 (Wants/Needs/Savings) model. You can also include transactions to keep track of expenses within each category.

# Limits
Currently, this application is developed using Expo. For future updates, I am planning to deploy the application on Android and then IOS while also using some type of back-end to store data.
